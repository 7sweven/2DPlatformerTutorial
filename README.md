## Day 5(?)

today (tomorrow from this update) we worked on being able to handle multiple animations at once.

we added new animations for falling/jumping, and made connections to every single variable (enable loop time, disable transition time stuff) 

in the playercontroller we make a new enum to store all possible player states.

remove the isRunning var from the animator, add new int called state

do the code.

done.
