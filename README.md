## Day 6 (?)

### Today we are going to have objects we can collect and add a counter for them!

- create object, give it the corresponding sprite
- create animation with the corresponding images
- give it a BoxCollider2D, isTrigger, give it a new tag
- create itemCollector script

For the counter:
- create new textmeshpro, install stuff if necessary
- add the stuff in script

if extra time, show how to add custom fonts and add to level


## Day 5(?)

today (tomorrow from this update) we worked on being able to handle multiple animations at once.

we added new animations for falling/jumping, and made connections to every single variable (enable loop time, disable transition time stuff) 

in the playercontroller we make a new enum to store all possible player states.

remove the isRunning var from the animator, add new int called state

do the code.

done.
